## 1 Hierarchy of ML Services on Public Cloud
Not all ML services are built the same. As a consultant working in the public cloud, I can tell you that you are spoilt for options for machine learning on the market. It can be difficult to, as I started out, to be able to process and synthesize the torrential wave of information in order to come to a decision on which service to use for your machine learning problem.

Just imagine how much of a nightmare of a task it would be to explain to your CTO / CIO without an expert in ML background, about which platform to choose, and why this particular service. 

I'm writing this post to hope to alleviate that for others, as well as for myself, so you walk away with a succinct understanding of what the public cloud has to offer, and can come back to reference this post when you need the details.

1. Level 100 - Pre-built APIs
2. Level 200 - AutoML services
3. Level 300 - Custom Model build

We will also discuss more about the MLOps capabilities each platform offers aside from the model building and serving phase.

## 2 The ML Lifecycle
Before we jump into it, I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss the typical machine learning (ML) lifecycle, so we understand the complexity of just what is managed and abstracted away from us.

The typical ML lifecycle looks a bit like this:


## 3 Pre-Built APIs

## 4 AutoML *

## 5 Custom Model Build


## 6 The Decision Tree


## 7 Services Table
